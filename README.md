## :dart: About ##

 Problem Statement :-
The destination page for Armenia Tours on the Exodus website is experiencing a lower than desired conversion rate. The hypothesis is that by shortening the description content, users are more likely to notice and engage with the Call To Action sections, ultimately increasing tour bookings.


Solution Overview :-
The provided JavaScript and CSS aim to address the issue by implementing a "Show More" functionality for the description content. By default, only a portion of the description is visible, and users have the option to expand the content by clicking "Show More." This design ensures that the critical Call To Action sections are more prominent, potentially improving user engagement.
